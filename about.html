    <p>For over 110 years, as the floral-gifting experts, we’ve been 
        helping you give with more care, with greater ease, and with 
        more meaning. Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, 
        Florists’ Transworld Delivery (FTD) used the telegraph to transform 
        the age-old practice of flower-giving. We understood then the unique 
        power of flowers to express a sentiment and helped people across the 
        world “Say it with flowers.” Today, we have grown into an extensive 
        network made up of thousands of local florists — each one an artisan 
        who is handcrafting and hand-delivering fine bouquets all across the 
        country. When you’re giving with FTD you’re giving the gift of joy, 
        strength, and love and you're giving it with meaning.</p>
